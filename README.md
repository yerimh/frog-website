This is my Creative Project 2 for CSE 154 at University of Washington. This website is less to show off my technical skills and more to show off my visual storytelling skills.
(I can't actually host a website for it because you can only host one website per github account, if anyone knows how I can host this for free somewhere, let me know thank you ìÜè)
